# Computer Vision Projects

This folder contains computer vision projects focused on image processing,
image classification, object detection, and visual recognition tasks.

The projects demonstrate end-to-end computer vision pipelines, including
data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-world applications.

## Topics Covered
- Image classification using CNNs
- Object detection (e.g., vehicles, traffic signs)
- Face analysis and image manipulation
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Image watermarking and security applications

## Techniques & Models
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer Learning (e.g., pretrained models)
- Object Detection models (e.g., YOLO)
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Feature extraction and visualization

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder and typically includes:
- A README explaining the problem and approach
- One or more notebooks or scripts
- Sample results or visualizations (where applicable)

## Goal
The goal of these projects is to apply computer vision techniques to solve
real-world problems such as image classification, detection, recognition,
and document analysis.
