# YOLO Object Detection

Object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.

## Description
Real-time object detection that can identify multiple objects in images/video.

## Approach
- Uses pre-trained YOLO model
- Processes images through neural network
- Non-maximum suppression for filtering detections

## Requirements
- OpenCV
- YOLO weights and configuration files
- COCO dataset classes
