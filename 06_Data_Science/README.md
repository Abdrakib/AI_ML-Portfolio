# Data Science Projects

This folder contains data science projects focused on exploring, analyzing,
and extracting insights from structured and unstructured data.

The projects emphasize data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA),
feature analysis, and visualization rather than predictive modeling.

## Topics Covered
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis
- Text and behavioral data analysis
- Visualization and insight generation

## Techniques & Methods
- Data parsing and transformation
- Group-by analysis and aggregations
- Regular expressions for text extraction
- Frequency and trend analysis
- Visual storytelling using charts and plots

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Regular Expressions (`re`)

## Project Structure
Each project in this folder typically includes:
- A README explaining the problem and approach
- One or more notebooks or scripts
- Visualizations and analytical results

## Goal
The goal of these projects is to turn raw data into meaningful insights
that help understand patterns, behaviors, and trends in real-world datasets.
