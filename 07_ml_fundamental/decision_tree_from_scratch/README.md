# Decision Tree from Scratch

## Description
This project implements a Decision Tree algorithm from scratch without using
high-level machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

The goal of this implementation is to understand how decision trees work
internally, including how data is split and how predictions are made.

## What This Project Covers
- Tree structure and node representation
- Recursive tree construction
- Feature-based data splitting
- Stopping conditions for tree growth
- Making predictions by traversing the tree

## Approach
1. Define a node structure to represent decision points and leaf nodes
2. Recursively split the dataset based on selected features
3. Stop splitting when predefined conditions are met
4. Traverse the constructed tree to make predictions

## Key Concepts
- Recursive algorithms
- Tree-based model logic
- Decision paths
- Model interpretability

## Files
- `Decision_tree_from_scratch.ipynb` — complete implementation of a decision
  tree built from scratch

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas (for data handling)

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   Decision_tree_from_scratch.ipynb
