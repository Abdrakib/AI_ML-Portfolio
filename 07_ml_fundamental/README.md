# Machine Learning Fundamentals (From Scratch)

This folder contains implementations of core machine learning algorithms
built from scratch to understand their internal working mechanisms.

These projects focus on learning and understanding the mathematics and
logic behind machine learning models rather than achieving high accuracy
on real-world datasets.

## Topics Covered
- Decision Trees from scratch
- Backpropagation and neural networks from scratch
- Gradient-based optimization
- Loss functions and parameter updates

## Goal
The goal of these implementations is to gain a deep understanding of how
machine learning algorithms work internally beyond using high-level
libraries.
