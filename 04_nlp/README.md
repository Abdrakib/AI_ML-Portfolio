# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

This folder contains projects focused on processing, analyzing, and
understanding human language using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques.

The projects demonstrate complete NLP pipelines, from raw text
preprocessing to feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Topics Covered
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Tokenization and stopword removal
- Text vectorization (Bag of Words, TF-IDF)
- Text classification and sentiment analysis
- Recommendation systems (text-based)
- Exploratory text analysis

## Techniques & Methods
- Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF
- Machine learning models for text classification
- Similarity-based methods for recommendations

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Project Structure
Each project in this folder includes:
- A README explaining the problem and approach
- One or more notebooks or scripts
- Evaluation results and observations

## Goal
The goal of these projects is to apply NLP techniques to solve real-world
problems such as sentiment analysis, review classification, and text-based
recommendation systems.
