# Audio Classification

## Problem
Classify audio samples into different categories based on their sound
characteristics.

## Dataset
Audio dataset containing labeled sound samples.
Audio signals are converted into numerical features for model training.

## Approach
1. Load and preprocess audio files
2. Extract audio features (e.g., MFCC, Mel-spectrogram)
3. Normalize and prepare input data
4. Train deep learning models
5. Evaluate model performance

## Models Used
- Neural Network / CNN 

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Loss

## Results
The trained model was able to learn meaningful audio features
and achieve good classification performance on the validation data.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook: `audio_classification.ipynb`
2. Install required libraries
3. Run all cells sequentially

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Librosa
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
